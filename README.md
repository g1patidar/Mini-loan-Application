#Project Title: Mini Loan Application

Description: Developed a mini loan application using the MERN stack with JWT authentication to provide a secure platform for users to apply for loans. Implemented admin features to manage loan applications and change loan status

#Key Achievements:
User Authentication: Implemented user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and cookies, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and utilize the loan application features.

#Role-Based Access Control: Designed and implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between regular users and administrators. Admins have the privilege to change loan status.
we have to change the role in mongoDB for administrations (role = "admin").

#Responsive UI Design: To create a visually appealing and responsive user interface, enhancing user interaction and accessibility.

#Loan Application Workflow: Developed a streamlined loan application workflow that guides users through the process of applying for loans, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

#Admin Functionality: Created an admin dashboard with the capability to view and manage loan applications, change loan statuses, and make informed decisions.

#API Integration: Interfaced with backend APIs for handling user authentication, loan application submission, and admin functionalities, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

#Deployment: Successfully deployed the application to a web server, making it accessible to users for testing and evaluation.
